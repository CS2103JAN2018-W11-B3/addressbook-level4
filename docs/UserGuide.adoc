== Introduction

Infinity Book is an address book application for Tech recruiters who *prefer to use a desktop app to keep track candidates' information, job postings, and interview*.  +

Infinity Book provides end-to-end support, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews. +

More importantly, Infinity Book is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (link:#cli[CLI]) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]). If you can type fast, Infinity Book can get your candidates management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +
