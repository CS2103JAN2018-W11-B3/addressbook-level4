== Introduction

Infinity Book (IB) is for those Tech recruiters who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing candidates*.  +

More importantly, IB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (link:#cli[CLI]) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (link:#gui[GUI]). If you can type fast, IB can get your candidates management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. +

== About

This User Guide introduces a user to Infinity Book, provides set up instructions and details the features of the product.
This document does not assume any prior knowledge, and the glossary explains any technical terms.

[NOTE]
For information about implementation and architecture, please refer to the Developer Guide.

== Quick Start
If you are a first time user, this section will help you get started with Infinity Book in 5 easy steps:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
Refer to <<FAQ>> for instructions to check Java version.
+
.  Download the latest `infinitybook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.The User Interface.

+

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Set up is now complete. You should see the interface as shown in Figure 1. Try some example commands shown here:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

[NOTE]

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
