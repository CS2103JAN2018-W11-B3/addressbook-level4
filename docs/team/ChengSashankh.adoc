---

IB provides *end-to-end support*, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews.

== Summary of contributions

. *Major enhancement*: *Job Postings*

** *What it does*:Allows the recruiter to add a job posting along with preferred location, skills, tags and position title. These jobs can be matched to candidate automatically, or edited, listed, searched and deleted.
** *Justification*: This feature makes all the information in the Infinity Book useful to a recruiter by providing a direct method to match and access relevant data on the Infinity Book for their job.
** *Highlights*:
*** For meaningful implementation of job matching, this enhancement adds a skills field to both Person and Job. This field details the skills possessed by a candidate and those required by the job.
*** This enhancement modifies the structure of the model and data handling in the entire application was modified to suit an additional primary data list. Implementation required many changes to the testing tools of the Infinity Book as well.

. *Minor enhancement*: Auto-correct and auto-complete
** *What it does*: Allows the recruiter to auto-complete and auto-correct command words automatically.
** *Justification*: This feature allows the recruiter to interact with the command line interface with increased accuracy.
** *Highlights*:
*** Auto-correct finds and corrects misspelt command words at one edit distance even in copy pasted commands without affecting arguments.
*** Auto-complete cycles through all possible completion on multiple key press.
