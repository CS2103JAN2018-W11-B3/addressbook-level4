== PROJECT: Infinity Book

---

== Overview

Infinity Book (IB) is an address book application for Tech recruiters who prefer to use a desktop app for managing candidates.

IB provides end-to-end support, from searching for candidates,to adding job postings and saving their resumes and interviews.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of Dashboard Reporting and Tagging features.

** Description: Dashboard Reporting allows user to visualize statistics of the group of candidates tagged with a specific tag so that they can have an overview of candidates in their contact list within a few keystrokes.
** Justification: Infinity Book helps recruiters process candidateâ€™s information faster. Aligning with this vision, I implemented two features:
*** First, recruiters may have to screen through one candidate's profile many times, which costs time. Thus, I improved `edit` command so that recruiters can add new tags or remove current tags from candidates. This enables them to summarize each candidate in a few keywords to save time for their future reference.
*** Second, recruiters need to make decisions and understand actions they have to take based on candidates' information in their contact list. But their list is overwhelmingly long, so I implemented `Report` feature showing them statistics from Tags they have added so that recruiters can have an idea of what is happening without going through each record. And numbers may be boring, so I represented it in charts to give them a better visualization.
** Highlights: This enhancement touches multiple components:
*** Added a new Report to the Model component to encapsulate report details.
*** Modified Logic component to accept new commands and provide information needed to display the report on UI.
*** Modified Storage component so that IB can store report persistently among sessions.
*** Added a new panel to display the report and ensured this UI component updates whenever recruiters update candidate' information.

* *Minor enhancement*: Improvement of `Find` command.
** Previous Implementation: In the previous iteration of the product, `Find` only allows users to search by contacts' name.
** Since Infinity Book v1.2, recruiters can find candidates by their name, email, phone, and tags.
** Justification: Given the huge number of contacts that a recruiter has, it is not possible for them to remember candidates' name. Hence, recruiters must be able to search by other fields so that it is easier for them to locate a person.

* *Minor enhancement*: UI Overhaul.
